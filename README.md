## Project Background
The Coffee Shop Sales - Analytics Project was initiated to enhance operational efficiency and uncover actionable insights for a coffee shop. With the growing competitiveness in the food and beverage industry, data-driven decision-making is crucial for optimizing revenue streams, identifying sales trends, and improving business operations.

This project leverages SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make informed business decisions.

- The primary dataset used for this analysis, which consists of detailed sales transaction information, can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales?resource=download).
- The SQL queries used to clean, organize, identify, and prepare data for the dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/sachinbasyal/Coffee-Shop-Data-Analytics/blob/main/SQL%20Queries.pdf).
