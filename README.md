## Problem Statement

### A. KPI's Requirement:
(1) Total Sales Analysis:
- Calculate the total sales for each respective month
- Determine the month-on-month (MoM) increase or decrease in sales
- Calculate the difference in sales between the selected month and the previous month

(2) Total Order Analysis:
- Calculate the total no. of orders for each respective month
- Determine the month-on-month (MoM) increase or decrease in the no. of orders

- Determine the month-on-month (MoM) increase or decrease in the total quantity sold
- Calculate the difference in the total quantity sold between the selected month and the previous month

### B. Chart Requirement:
(1) Calendar Heat Map:
- Implement a calendar heat map that dynamically adjusts based on the selected month from a slicer

- Each day on the calendar will be color-coded to represent sales volume, wih darker shades indicating higher sales

- Implement tooltips to display detailed matrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over a specific day

(2) Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends:

- Highlight MoM sales increase or decrease for each store location to identify trends

(4) Daily Sales Analysis over Average Sales Line:
- Display daily sales for the selected month with a line chart
- Incorporate an average line on the char to represent the average daily sales
